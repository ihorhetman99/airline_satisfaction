# Airline passenger satisfaction

This is a Data science pet project made by Ihor Hetman. 
In this project I took a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) from a passanger survey made by airline companies in order to create a machine learning model that predict satisfaction level and to find out factors which have the biggest impact on customer's decision.

For visual purposes it was created a [web application](https://ihorhetman99-airline-satisfaction-web-applicationapp-afkxpy.streamlitapp.com/).

# Description of a project
This project contained of two parts. In the first one, I made a exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. Based on the EDA's results and observations it was trained a Random forest and obtained a classifier with next values of performance metrics:
|Accuracy|Precision|Recall|
|-----| ----- | ----- |
|0.9 | 0.89 | 0.89 |

You can check the code for this part in the `model` folder.  

In the second part I created a web application using a open-source framework [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). In this application I added a possibility for user to create a custom input and predict an imaginary answer. 
Also, you can check the code for this part in `web_application` folder.
